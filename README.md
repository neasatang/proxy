# proxy

The objective of the exercise is to implement a Web Proxy Server using Websockets. A Web proxy is a local server, which fetches items from the Web on behalf of a Web client instead of the client fetching them directly. This allows for caching of pages and access control.

- [ ] figure out how to block sites
- [ ] "Efficiently cache requests locally and thus save bandwidth. You must gather timing and
bandwidth data to prove the efficiency of your proxy."
- [ ] try and cater for HTTPS requests (80%)
- [ ] fix my connect response - give a 200 response and something, im tired
